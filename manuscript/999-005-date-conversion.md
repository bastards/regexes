# Ordering names and dates (TODO)

One of the most frequent questions on the the NICAR mailing list

Getting data ready for spreadsheets is one of the most tedious tasks.


### Scenario


#### Prerequisites

* Knowing how to match character sets
* Knowing how to match repeated patterns
* Capturing groups


## Year, months, days


### MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD

If there is some kind of delimiter between the components of the date, such as the forward slash `/` or a hyphen, then it's pretty straightforward to just target the digits with capturing groups.

Let's say we have dates in this format: `MM/DD/YYYY`

	09/06/1987
	12/05/2001
	05/16/2012
	10/10/2010
