Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
Hor. Friends to this ground.
Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
Fran. Give you good night.

##                                             Spreads his arms.##  If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,##  Speak to me.##  If there be any good thing to be done,##  That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,##  Speak to me.##
##                                               The cock crows.##

Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing##  Upon a fearful summons. I have heard##  The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,##  Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat##  Awake the god of day; and at his warning,##  Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,##
##                               Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.##
##                              Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,##  Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!##
##        Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.##
Hor. Hail to your lordship!
Ham. I am glad to see you well.##

Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
Ham. What hour now?
Hor. I think it lacks of twelve.
Mar. No, it is struck.
Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season##  Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.##                 A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.##  What does this mean, my lord?
Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,##
##                       Enter Ghost.##
Hor. Look, my lord, it comes!
Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us!##
##                                         Ghost beckons Hamlet.
Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,##  As if it some impartment did desire##  To you alone.
Mar. Look with what courteous action##  It waves you to a more removed ground.##  But do not go with it!
Hor. No, by no means!
Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
Hor. Do not, my lord!
Ham. Why, what should be the fear?##

King. How may we try it further?
Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together##
##               Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.##
Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away##
##                     Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].##  How does my good Lord Hamlet?
Ham. Well, God-a-mercy.
Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
Ham. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.
Pol. Not I, my lord.
Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
Pol. Honest, my lord?
Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man##
##                  Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.##
Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
Ham. These tedious old fools!
Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.

Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!##  That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling##
##                   Enter four or five Players.####  You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee##  well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is##
##       Black as his purpose, did the night resemble##       When he lay couched in the ominous horse,##
##       With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot##
##       With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,##
##       That lend a tyrannous and a damned light##
##       With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus##
##    Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,##    Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,##
##    Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;##    But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword##
##    Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top##    Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash##
##    Which was declining on the milky head##
##    So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,##    And, like a neutral to his will and matter,##    Did nothing.##    But, as we often see, against some storm,##    A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,##    The bold winds speechless, and the orb below##    As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder##
##    Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;##
##    Now falls on Priam.##    Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,##    In general synod take away her power;##    Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,##    And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,##    As low as to the fiends!##
##    With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head##    Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,##
##    A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-##
##    But if the gods themselves did see her then,##    When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport##
##    The instant burst of clamour that she made##    (Unless things mortal move them not at all)##    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven##

Ham. To be, or not to be- that is the question:##
##                 Enter King and Polonius.##
King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;##
##                                               Exeunt Players.####          Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.####  How now, my lord? Will the King hear this piece of work?
Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
Ham. Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two##  help to hasten them?
Both. We will, my lord.                       Exeunt they two.
Ham. What, ho, Horatio!####                    Enter Horatio.##
##    Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard##                     carrying torches.##
Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.##
##             Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.####  Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing##  him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation##  unto him.

##                                                       Exeunt.##
Oph. What means this, my lord?
Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.####                    Enter Prologue.##
Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;##
##    Here stooping to your clemency,##    We beg your hearing patiently.                     [Exit.]##
##            Enter [two Players as] King and Queen.####
##    And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen##    About the world have times twelve thirties been,##    Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,##    Unite comutual in most sacred bands.##  Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon##
##    But woe is me! you are so sick of late,##    So far from cheer and from your former state.##    That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,##    Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;##
##    In neither aught, or in extremity.##    Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;##
##    Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;##    Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.##  King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;##    My operant powers their functions leave to do.##    And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,##
##    For husband shalt thou-##  Queen. O, confound the rest!##    Such love must needs be treason in my breast.##    When second husband let me be accurst!##    None wed the second but who killed the first.##
Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!####  Queen. The instances that second marriage move##    Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.##    A second time I kill my husband dead##    When second husband kisses me in bed.##  King. I do believe you think what now you speak;##    But what we do determine oft we break.##    Purpose is but the slave to memory,##    Of violent birth, but poor validity;##    Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,##    But fill unshaken when they mellow be.##
##    To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.##    What to ourselves in passion we propose,##    The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.##    The violence of either grief or joy##    Their own enactures with themselves destroy.##    Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;##    Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.##
##    That even our loves should with our fortunes change;##
##    Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.##    The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,##
##    And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,##    For who not needs shall never lack a friend,##    And who in want a hollow friend doth try,##    Directly seasons him his enemy.##    But, orderly to end where I begun,##    Our wills and fates do so contrary run##    That our devices still are overthrown;##    Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.##    So think thou wilt no second husband wed;##    But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.##  Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,##    Sport and repose lock from me day and night,##    To desperation turn my trust and hope,##
##    Each opposite that blanks the face of joy##    Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,##    Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,##    If, once a widow, ever I be wife!##
Ham. If she should break it now!####
##    My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile##    The tedious day with sleep.##  Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,##                                                  [He] sleeps.##    And never come mischance between us twain!##
##                       Enter Lucianus.####  This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see##  the puppets dallying.
Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
Oph. Still better, and worse.
Ham. So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave##  thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth##  bellow for revenge.####  Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;##    Confederate season, else no creature seeing;##    Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,##
##    Thy natural magic and dire property##    On wholesome life usurp immediately.##                                 Pours the poison in his ears.##
##                            Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,##        The hart ungalled play;##       For some must watch, while some must sleep:##        Thus runs the world away.##  Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers- if the rest of my##
##       For thou dost know, O Damon dear,##         This realm dismantled was##       Of Jove himself; and now reigns here##
##       For if the King like not the comedy,##       Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.##  Come, some music!####              Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.##
##                   Enter the Players with recorders.####  O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do##  you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me##  into a toil?
Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
Guil. My lord, I cannot.
Ham. I pray you.
Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
Ham. I do beseech you.
Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your##  fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will##

Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;##

##          [Makes a pass through the arras and] kills Polonius.
Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,##  As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
Queen. As kill a king?
Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.##                       [Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]##  Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!##  I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.##

Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-##

Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.##  This bodiless creation ecstasy##  Is very cunning in.
Ham. Ecstasy?##  My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time##  And makes as healthful music. It is not madness##

King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend##  Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit##  Behind the arras hearing something stir,##
