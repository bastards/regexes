# The Exercises

I've never been one to  to expand my mind. And regular expressions, in my opinion, are just about the least fun thing you could learn "just for the fun of it".

To me, the "fun" part is using them. OK, maybe "fun" isn't the word...the "satisfying" part of regexes is using them to avoid really, really tedious work. And in some cases, to enable fun outputs.

So if you skimmed through the regex syntax lessons, go ahead and browse the stand alone exercises. Some of these scenarios are contrived, while some are variations of real-world data journalism problems I've run into.
